These are those parts of ManuProC's main c++ library which are of 
interest to a wider user group.

This library contains:

- guaranteed zero terminating equivalents of snprintf and strncpy
	(please, NEVER use sprintf and strcpy! -> Buffer overflow)

- integer to string (itos) functions

- Date/Time conversion functions

- SQL wrapper classes (database

- Handle classes

- Caching classes

and perhaps more.

I apologize for not documenting them up to now and (of course) these 
classes have a long history so they sometimes start to smell ...

Use them, improve them, share them.
